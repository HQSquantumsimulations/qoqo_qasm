/// QASM backend to qoqo
///
/// This backend to qoqo produces QASM output which can be exported.
///
/// This backend takes a qoqo circuit to be run on a certain device and returns a QASM file
/// containing the translated circuit. The circuit itself is translated using the qoqo_qasm
/// interface. In this backend, the initialization sets up the relevant parameters and the run
/// function calls the QASM interface and writes the QASM file, which is saved to be used by the
/// user on whatever platform they see fit. QASM input is widely supported on various quantum
/// computing platforms.
